Project Proposal Document

Nabcotech Web Development Class of 2025

Project Title

SmartCanteen🚀 – A Digital Ordering and Delivery System for Campus Canteen

 Executive Summary

The Nabcotech Web Development Class of 2025 identified a common challenge faced by students within the school canteen — long queues and delays in getting meals or items during peak hours. To address this, the team developed SmartCanteen, a web-based e-commerce platform that enables students to order food and canteen items online and have them delivered directly to their table or ready for pickup upon arrival.

SmartCanteen streamlines the canteen experience by integrating technology, convenience, and speed. Students can browse available meals, place orders in advance, make secure payments online, and receive notifications when their orders are ready.

This innovation aims to improve students’ productivity and comfort while also helping the canteen operate more efficiently.

Problem Statement

Every day, students spend several minutes — sometimes up to an hour — standing in long queues at the canteen. This causes:

* Time wastage, especially during short breaks between classes.
* Increased crowding and stress in the canteen area.
* Delays in meal preparation and service.
* Reduced productivity for both students and canteen staff.

This problem affects both students and canteen vendors, resulting in inefficiency and poor user experience.

Proposed Solution

Our solution, SmartCanteen, eliminates the need for physical queuing by allowing students to:

* Browse canteen menus online in real-time.
* Place and pay for orders before arriving at the canteen.
* Get notified when their food is ready for pickup or delivery.
* Enjoy faster and smoother service.

Vendors, on the other hand, can:

* Manage orders digitally through a dashboard.
* Track payments automatically.
* Prepare meals in order of online demand.
* Improve customer satisfaction and operational flow.

 Key Features

1. Online Menu Display:
   Students can view available meals, snacks, and drinks from various canteen sections.

2. Easy Ordering System:
   Orders can be placed from mobile or desktop devices anytime, anywhere.

3. Payment Integration (Paystack):
   Secure online payments using debit/credit cards or bank transfers.

4. Order Management Dashboard:
   Vendors can view, confirm, and update order status in real-time.

5. Delivery or Pickup Options:
   Students can choose whether to receive their orders at their table or pick them up when ready.

6. Notifications and Updates:
   Automatic updates on order status (e.g., “In Progress,” “Ready for Pickup,” etc.).
